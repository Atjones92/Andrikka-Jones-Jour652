        <p>COVE POINT - The natural gas pipes on Dominion’s Cove Point property begin on a pier in the Chesapeake Bay. They then descend underground and run for more than a mile behind the walls of a dimly-lit tunnel for foot-brake bicycles that workers use to travel from the dock to shore. Above ground, the pipes pass acres of trees and finally connect to seven massive storage tanks before the gas ultimately travels to American consumers.</p>
        
        <p>This winter, they have been empty of the imported gas that filled them for years. But now, Dominion and Maryland are bracing for the Chesapeake Bay dock, which was once a starting point for imported gas’ journey on American soil, to be the takeoff spot for exports.</p>
        
        <p>When that happens, Cove Point will become the first operational gas exporting facility on the East Coast. Dominion plans to begin construction by the end of the year.</p>
        
        <p>The plan to export gas has raised questions across the state about whether the plant will be a boon for the economy or cause significant damage to the environment.</p>
        
        <p>Some Marylanders see the export plant, like Dominion does, as a job-creating opportunity for the state that is more environmentally-friendly than coal production.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            “It gives us a chance to export something,” said Delegate James Proctor, D-Calvert and Prince George’s.
        </blockquote>

        <p>But others see the conversion as an environmental hazard that exposes all of Maryland to the potential risks of gas obtained through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and fear it could lead to use of the controversial gas-extraction method within the state.</p>

        <p>For Dominion executives, the switch is logical due to increased global demand for American gas and, with $3.8 billion worth of changes, will be an efficient way to use the existing facility.</p>

        <p>“It’s the same thing,” said Mike Frederick, vice president of Dominion’s LNG operations. “It’s just in reverse.”</p>

        <h2>From the Eastern Shore to the Western Mountains</h2>
        
        <p>Paul Roberts, who owns Deep Creek Cellars, a winery in Garrett County, said his business has been doing well for the past few years. But he has been hesitant to hire more employees or expand his facility because he’s not sure whether there will be a renewed interest in leasing land in Maryland that the Marcellus Shale basin runs under for potential future drilling causing land prices to go up, he said.</p>

        <blockquote>
            “I have to decide if it’s worth staying in Maryland any longer. I’m just at that point,” said Roberts, who is also the cofounder of Citizen Shale, a Western Maryland group against fracking.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Fracking in Maryland is currently not allowed under Gov. Martin O’Malley’s order that prevents the Maryland Department of the Environment from approving drilling permits until the end of an ongoing scientific study examining the gas extraction process. However, the study ordered by O’Malley is planned to be finalized later this year and Mike Tidwell, director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said he fears a gas export facility in Cove Point will lead the state government to allow fracking in Maryland.</p>

        <h2>The Economics of Natural Gas</h2>
        
        <p>In addition to environmental concerns surrounding the plant, some question what will happen to domestic gas prices if gas is exported from Maryland. Diana Dascalu-Joffe, senior general counsel for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said that because demand for natural gas is rising in the United States and many coal-fired power plants are being shut down, residents could expect higher prices if Maryland began exporting natural gas.</p>

        <p>But John Felmy, a chief economist with the American Petroleum Institute, said the supply of American gas is high enough to handle the demand without affecting consumer prices in Maryland.</p>

        <p>“All the development of natural gas we’ve had, there’s still a lot that can come forth,” he said.</p>
